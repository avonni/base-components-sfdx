# Avonni Components

## Introduction

Avonni Components are customizable pre-made components built using the Lightning Web Components standards. It allows you to extend the possibilities of what you can create on the Salesforce Platform.

## Vision

The Lightning Component Library is an incredible starting point for application development, but with a growing demand for engaging, high-impact business applications, they do not cover all aspects or needs developers are looking for. With Avonni Components, we want to become whatever is generally useful for developing business solutions on the Lightning platform, all in the spirit of the Lightning Web Component framework. 

Avonni Components helps: 

*   Standardize Lightning development across different projects
    
*   Reduce maintenance overhead 
    
*   Deliver fully composable Lightning components
    
*   Build new apps faster
